Install
-------

GUM is a Grok application. A GUM buildout can be created with zc.buildout.

To get started you would do something like this:

  $ hg clone http://bcgsc.ca/scm/hg.repo/gum
  $ cd gum
  $ ./bootstrap/bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

You should now be able to bring up the application with:

  $ ./bin/zopectl start

The default buildout will install additional parts for development and 
testing. To install just the parts required to use in a production 
environment use:

 $ ./bin/buildout -c production.cfg


LDAP Instance
-------------

To default buildout of GUM configures an LDAP instance. You must have
OpenLDAP pre-installed (currently this works on Mac OS X, will need tweaking
for other OSes). You must start this instance before running the app or
functional tests:

  $ ./bin/slapd start

If you need to debug LDAP, it can be started in debug mode with:

  $ /usr/libexec/slapd -f ./parts/slapd/slapd.conf -d 255 \
    -h ldap://127.0.0.1:1700

Note that the functional tests expect the server to start on port 1700.


TO-DO
-----

Some bits still require manual intervention:

 * python-ldap bindings need to be installed into your Python.

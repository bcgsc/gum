User Modify
***********

:Test-Layer: functional

Our functional testing set-up has created and configured a working
instance of a GUM site. It connects to an LDAP testing environment:

  >>> gumsite = getRootFolder()['gumsite']
  >>> dbc = gumsite.ldap_connection()
  >>> str(dbc)[:42]
  '<ldapadapter.utility.LDAPConnection object'

We can create a new user by supplying a unique name:

  >>> from gum.user import User
  >>> caveman = User('caveman')

The User object implements the IUser interface, this is a schema that
describes all data about a User:

  >>> from gum.interfaces import IUser
  >>> IUser.providedBy(caveman)
  True

We can modify the User object:

  >>> caveman.cn = 'GROK SMASH'
  >>> caveman.sn = 'Zope'
  >>> caveman.givenName = 'GROK'
  >>> caveman.description = 'ME GROK!'
  >>> caveman.telephoneNumber = ['1-900-HOT-GROK',]
  >>> caveman.street = ['Plains of Africa']
  >>> caveman.roomNumber = ['Cave #101']

Setting the object in our Users container saves the data into LDAP:

  >>> gumsite['users'][caveman.uid] = caveman

Group memberships can be managed with Views on the User object. We will
add the caveman to the employee group:

  >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()
  >>> request.form['gid'] = 'employee'
  >>> class TestPrincipal(object):
  ...     id = 'ssmith'
  >>> request.setPrincipal( TestPrincipal() )
  >>> grant_membership_view = getMultiAdapter((caveman, request), name='grant')
  >>> grant_membership_view.update()
  >>> gumsite['groups']['employee'].uids
  [u'jdoe', u'ssmith', u'caveman']

And then we will remove the caveman from the employee group:

  >>> revoke_membership_view = getMultiAdapter((caveman, request), name='revoke')
  >>> revoke_membership_view.update()
  >>> gumsite['groups']['employee'].uids
  [u'jdoe', u'ssmith']

We can have two User objects that refer to the same ldap entry. Normally
we wouldn't want to do this, but it is useful for testing:

  >>> groktwin = User('caveman')
  >>> (groktwin.cn, groktwin.givenName) == (caveman.cn, caveman.givenName)
  True
  >>> (groktwin.street, groktwin.roomNumber) == (caveman.street, caveman.roomNumber)
  True

We can delete an entry. In Zope 3 style, delete is the responsibility of
the Users container:

  >>> del gumsite['users']['caveman']
